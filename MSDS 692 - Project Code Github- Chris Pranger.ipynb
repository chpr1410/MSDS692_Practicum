    "#### 1. Data Downloader \n",
    "    - Build the Database.  Builds separate databases for FY and FQ data.\n",
    "#### 2. Backtest - Filtering\n",
    "    - Queries the MongoDB database to get a list of healthy companies and their relevant period\n",
    "#### 3. Backtest - Pricing \n",
    "    - Takes the list of healthy companies and gets prices for the company at the start of the period \n",
    "    and in subsequent periods to measure growth.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 4. Machine Learning - Constructing the Models and Training them on Additional Features\n",
    "    - For the healthy companies, download additional features (financial metrics) and train a neural network to classify\n",
    "    high performing healthy companies and low performing healthy companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Database Updater \n",
    "    - Update the database daily/frequently.  Adds new companies and new financial periods to existing companies.\n",
    "#### 6. Stock Screener \n",
    "    - Scans the database for companies that are healthy in the most recent period.\n",
    "    - Run every time the database is updated to determine if any healthy companies/periods have been added.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 7. ML Models' Classifications of Screened Companies\n",
    "    - Takes the results from the screener (Part 6) and inputs them into the models, which outputs classification predictions"
