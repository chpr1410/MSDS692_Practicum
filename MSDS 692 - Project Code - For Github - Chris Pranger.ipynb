    "#### 1. Data Downloader \n",
    "    - Build the Database.  Builds separate databases for FY and FQ data.\n",
    "#### 2. Backtest - Filtering\n",
    "    - Queries the MongoDB database to get a list of healthy companies and their relevant period\n",
    "#### 3. Backtest - Pricing \n",
    "    - Takes the list of healthy companies and gets prices for the company at the start of the period \n",
    "    and in subsequent periods to measure growth.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 4. Machine Learning - Constructing the Models and Training them on Additional Features\n",
    "    - For the healthy companies, download additional features (financial metrics) and train a neural network to classify\n",
    "    high performing healthy companies and low performing healthy companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Database Updater \n",
    "    - Update the database daily/frequently.  Adds new companies and new financial periods to existing companies.\n",
    "#### 6. Stock Screener \n",
    "    - Scans the database for companies that are healthy in the most recent period.\n",
    "    - Run every time the database is updated to determine if any healthy companies/periods have been added.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 7. ML Models' Classifications of Screened Companies\n",
    "    - Takes the results from the screener (Part 6) and inputs them into the models, which outputs classification predictions"

First I had to structure the data differently than I have before, as I am using 2D Convolutional layers in my model.  These require a 2D input shape.  Before, the data is just in a dataframe.  I convert each row of the dataframe to be a 10 row by 29 column dataframe, and then convert that to an array.  The 10 rows are 10 years of data and the 290 columns are the financial metrics that are the features.\n",
